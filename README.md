# Angular & NestJS CRUD Project

This is a full-stack web application demonstrating how to build a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system using **Angular** for the frontend and **NestJS** for the backend, connected to a **PostgreSQL** database.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Frontend**: Built with **Angular 17** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**.
-   **Backend**: Powered by **NestJS 11** with **TypeORM** for database interaction.
-   **Database**: Uses **PostgreSQL** for data persistence.
-   **Full-Stack**: Complete setup for both client and server-side development.
-   **Ready to Run**: Includes detailed setup instructions for a smooth start.

##  Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1.  **Node.js**: Version `20.9.0` or higher. We highly recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager) to manage Node.js versions.
    ```bash
    # Example using nvm
    nvm install 20
    nvm use 20
    ```
2.  **Angular CLI**: Version `17.x.x`
    ```bash
    npm install -g @angular/cli@17
    ```
3.  **NestJS CLI**: Version `11.x.x`
    ```bash
    npm install -g @nestjs/cli@11
    ```
4.  **PostgreSQL**: A running instance of PostgreSQL. You can download it from the [official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
```

### 2. Set Up and Run the Backend (NestJS)

The backend server connects to a PostgreSQL database.

#### A. Set Up PostgreSQL Database

1.  **Install PostgreSQL** on your machine if you haven't already. You can find installers and instructions on the [PostgreSQL official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
2.  **Create a new database** for this project. You can use a GUI tool like [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) or the command-line interface (`psql`).

    Example using `psql`:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
    ```
3.  Make sure you have a user and password with access to this new database.

#### B. Configure Backend Environment

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory.
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Create a `.env` file by copying the example file.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
3.  Open the `.env` file and update it with your local PostgreSQL connection details.

    ```env
    # .env file for the backend
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_PORT=5432
    DB_USERNAME=your_postgres_user
    DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
    DB_DATABASE=mydatabase
    ```

#### C. Install Dependencies and Run

1.  Install the required npm packages.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  Run the development server. The server will automatically connect to your database and apply any necessary migrations.
    ```bash
    npm run start:dev
    ```

The backend server is now running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### 3. Set Up and Run the Frontend (Angular)

Open a **new terminal window** for this step, leaving the backend server running.

1.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory from the project root.
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    # Or from the root: cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install the required npm packages.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Run the Angular development server.
    ```bash
    ng serve
    ```

The frontend application is now running on `http://localhost:4200`.

### 4. Access the Application

Open your web browser and navigate to **[http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)**. You should now see the application running!
